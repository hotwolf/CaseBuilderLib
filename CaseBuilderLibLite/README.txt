// CaseBuilderLibLite
//###################
This is a simplified version of the CaseBuilderLib, which aims to be
compatible to the Thingiverse configurator.
The BaseBuilderLibLite only supports the generation of empty cases
(shell). The design of customized cavities is not supported.
All relevant includes of the CaseBuilderLib have been concatinated into
one source file.
