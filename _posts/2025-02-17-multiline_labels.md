title:  Multi-Line Labels

Thanks to [ColinNg](https://github.com/ColinNg), the [CaseBuilderLib](https://github.com/hotwolf/CaseBuilderLib/tree/master) now supports multi-line lables.
To use this feature, simply replace the "labT" string by an array of strings:

Each line can also have a different font size. This is done by replacing the "labS" variable by an array of numbers:
