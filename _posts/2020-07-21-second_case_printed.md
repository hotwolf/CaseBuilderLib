title:  Second case printed
---

I've printed a new case. 

![Open case]({{ site.url }}/images/2020-07-21-case_open.jpg)

The time from measuring the bottle that goes inside until I had a STL file to slic, was less than 10 minutes.
So, I think the CaseBuilderLib serves its purpose.

With this design I got an even number of hinge elements.

![Hinge]({{ site.url }}/images/2020-07-21-hinge.jpg)

Hinge and latch turned oout fine. The library bug that I've observed in the
[previous case]({ site.url }}/2020/07/17/first_case_printed.html) is fixed.
