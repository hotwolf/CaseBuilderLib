title:  Fourth case printed
---

Here is a new CaseBuilderLib design.
It took less than 10 minutes do design this case and it printed perfectly.

![Thermometer case]({{ site.url }}/images/2021-04-28-chalk_case.jpg)

I've noticed that this case opens up a lot smoother than the previous one.
Both cases use the same latch design, except that the previous (thermometer) case is narrower.
So one thing to keep in mind for a library improvement is to adjust the tightness of the latch depending on the distance to the hinge.
