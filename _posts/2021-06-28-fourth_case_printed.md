title:  Fourth case printed
---

Here is a new CaseBuilderLib design.
It took less than 10 minutes do design this case and it printed perfectly.

I've noticed that this case opens up a lot smoother than the (thermometer) previous one.
Both cases use the same latch design, except that the thermometer case is narrower.
So one thing to keep in mind for a library improvement is, to adjust the tightness of the latch depending on the distance to the hinge.
